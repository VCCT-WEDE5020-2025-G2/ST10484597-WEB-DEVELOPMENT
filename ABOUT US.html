   <h1 style="color: white;">History: </h1>
<p style="color: white;">Harvest & Hearth Café was founded during one of the toughest times for the hospitality industry — the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Childhood friends Lindiwe Mthethwa and Michael Harris, both passionate about food and community, decided to take a leap of faith. 
we converted a small, unused corner shop into a cozy café that felt like a living room, where every customer was treated like family. 
Our vision was simple: serve fresh, wholesome meals made with local ingredients, while building a space where people could connect, slow down, and feel at home. 
We partnered with nearby farmers and suppliers to ensure that every ingredient was seasonal and ethically sourced. This approach didn’t just create incredible food — it also helped support small-scale agriculture in KwaZulu-Natal. 
Within a year, Harvest & Hearth had become more than a café. It was a gathering place for food lovers, creatives, and entrepreneurs. They began hosting “Meet-the-Farmer” brunches, supper clubs with live music, and cooking workshops for locals wanting to learn farm-to-table cooking. 
Our environmentally conscious approach, from biodegradable packaging to composting food waste, earned them recognition as one of Durban’s most sustainable eateries.</P>
